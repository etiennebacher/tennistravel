This is my Shiny application for the [Shiny Contest 2021](https://community.rstudio.com/t/time-to-get-your-shiny-on-shiny-contest-2021-is-here/98632). See the app [here](https://etiennebacher.shinyapps.io/tennistravel/).

If you want to run the app locally, download this repo, open the R project, and run:
```
# devtools::install_github("thinkr-open/golem")
golem::run_dev()
```
